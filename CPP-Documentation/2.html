                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>C++ (pronounced see plus plus) was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs as an extension to C,
                    starting in 1979. C++ adds many new features to the C language, and is perhaps best thought of as a
                    superset of C, though this is not strictly true (as C99 introduced a few features that do not exist
                    in C++). C++’s claim to fame results primarily from the fact that it is an object-oriented language.
                    As for what an object is and how it differs from traditional programming methods, well, we’ll cover
                    that in chapter 8 (Basic object-oriented programming).
                    C++ was standardized in 1998 by the ISO committee (this means the ISO committee ratified a document
                    describing the C++ language, to help ensure all compilers adhered to the same set of standards). A
                    minor update was released in 2003 (called C++03).

                <h2>What you should already know</h2>
                <p>
                    The C language was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Telephone laboratories, primarily as
                    a systems programming language (a language to write operating systems with). Ritchie’s primary goals
                    were to produce a minimalistic language that was easy to compile, allowed efficient access to
                    memory, produced efficient code, and was self-contained (not reliant on other programs). For a
                    high-level language, it was designed to give the programmer a lot of control, while still
                    encouraging platform (hardware and operating system) independence (that is, the code didn’t have to
                    be rewritten for each platform).
                    C ended up being so efficient and flexible that in 1973, Ritchie and Ken Thompson rewrote most of
                    the Unix operating system using C. Many previous operating systems had been written in assembly.
                    Unlike assembly, which produces programs that can only run on specific CPUs, C has excellent
                    portability, allowing Unix to be easily recompiled on many different types of computers and speeding
                    its adoption. C and Unix had their fortunes tied together, and C’s popularity was in part tied to
                    the success of Unix as an operating system.

                <p>Variables are containers for storing data values.
                   In C++, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <span class="para">int</span> - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123
                        or
                        -123
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="para">double</span> - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99
                        or -19.99</li>
                    <li><span class="para">char</span> - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are
                        surrounded by single quotes
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="para">string</span> - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are
                        surrounded by double quotes</li>
                    <li><span class="para">bool</span> - stores values with two states: true or false
                    </li>

                <h2>Declaring Variables</h2>
                <p>
                    To create a variable, you must specify the type and assign it a value:
                    Syntax
                    type variable = value;
                    Where type is one of C++ types (such as int), and variable is the name of the variable (such as x or
                    myName). The equal sign is used to assign values to the variable.
                    <br>
                    To create a variable that should store a number, look at the following example:
                    <br>
                    Example
                    Create a variable called myNum of type int and assign it the value 15:
                    <br>
                    int myNum = 15;<br>
                    cout << <span class="output">myNum</span>;
                </p>

            <section id="string" class="main-section">
                <h2>Strings</h2>
                <p>Strings are used for storing text.
                    A string variable contains a collection of characters surrounded by double quotes:
                    <br>
                    <b>Example</b><br>
                    Create a variable of type string and assign it a value:
                    <br>
                    string greeting = "Hello";<br>
                    To use strings, you must include an additional header file in the source code, the &lt;string>
                    library:
                    <br>
                    <b>Example</b><br>
                    // Include the string library
                    #include &lt;string>

                <h2>Functions</h2>
                <p>
                    A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.<br>
                    You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.<br>
                    Functions are used to perform certain actions, and they are important for reusing code: Define the
                    code once, and use it many times.<br>

                    Create a Function<br>
                    C++ provides some pre-defined functions, such as main(), which is used to execute code. But you can
                    also create your own functions to perform certain actions.<br>
                    To create (often referred to as declare) a function, specify the name of the function, followed by
                    parentheses ():<br>

                    Syntax<br>
                    void myFunction() {<br>
                    <span class="output"> // code to be executed</span><br>
                    }<br><br>
                    Example Explained<br>
                <div class="code">
                    <span class="para">myFunction()</span> is the name of the function<br>
                    <span class="para">void</span> means that the function does not have a return value. You will learn
                    more about return values
                    later in the next chapter
                    inside the function (the body), add code that defines what the function should do<br>
                </div><br>

                Call a Function<br>
                Declared functions are not executed immediately. They are "saved for later use", and will be
                executed later, when they are called.<br>
                To call a function, write the function's name followed by two parentheses () and a semicolon ;<br>
                In the following example, myFunction() is used to print a text (the action), when it is
                called:<br><br>

                <br>Example</br>
                Inside main, call myFunction():<br>

                <h2>Arrays</h2>
                <p>
                    Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate
                    variables for each value.
                    To declare an array, define the variable type, specify the name of the array followed by square
                    brackets and specify the number of elements it should store:
                </p>
                <code class="code">
                    string cars[<span class="para">4</span>];
                </code>
                <p>We have now declared a variable that holds an array of four strings. To insert values to it, we can
                    use an array literal - place the values in a comma-separated list, inside curly braces:
                </p>
                <code class="code">
                    string cars[<span class="para">4</span>] = {<span class="para">"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford",
                        "Mazda"</span>};
                </code>
                <p>To create an array of three integers, you could write:</p>
                <code class="code">
                    int myNum[<span class="para">3</span>] = {<span class="para">10, 20, 30</span>};

                <h3>Access the Elements of an Array</h3>
                <p>You access an array element by referring to the index number.
